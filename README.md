# CDspec Project Website

This is the official website for the CDspec (Community District) project from Cornell Tech. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), the site showcases our research on Community Districts (CDs) and their impact on urban development and community engagement.

## [FOR STUDENTS] Editing Guidelines. 

Project pages are stored in [src/content/projects/](/src/content/projects)BID_NAME.md. Your BID should already have a file for it created. In this file, you will see a header at the top with metadata for your BID (general info about the BID, etc.). Also of note are the *component* fields. These correspond to the visualizations to be rendered for your Insight, Transformation, Prediction, and/or Consensus portions of your analysis. 

Put code modules (.jsx, .tsx, etc.) files for your visualizations in [/src/components/groups/](/src/components/groups)BID_NAME/ , and reference them appropriately in the header of your markdown file. **IMPORTANT** Then, you need to add your component to the component registry in [src/components/visualizations/ComponentRegistry.jsx](src/components/visualizations/ComponentRegistry.jsx), in the 'componentRegistry' dictionary. Without doing this, the site will not load your component and it will not work correctly in the production environment. 

Put images and media (.jpg, .png, etc.) files for your visualizations in [/public/components/groups/](/public/components/groups)BID_NAME/, and reference them appropriately in the header of your markdown file. See src/content/projects/robotability.md for an example project file. 

Please do NOT change the first-level section titles (#Insight Analysis, etc.). I have regex that searches for these headers and puts the interactive components in the correct location. Feel free to add your own second-level (##) and third-level (###) headers. 

**Please do not push directly to the repo. Instead, add your content and code on branches, and submit pull requests. I will review code and approve pull requests.** 

**We will not incorporate server-side rendering (SSR). All loading of interactive components should be client-side, so that everything can be wholly contained in the repository. If this isn't possible for your visualization, a video demo will suffice (upload to YouTube and embed, etc.)**

I highly encourage the use of AI-assisted development tools (a la GitHub CoPilot pro, which is free with the student developer pack), if you are unfamiliar with geospatial front-end development. Albeit through trial and error, this website is largely developed with CoPilot (the Claude 3.7 thinking model). 

If you need to add extra modules to the project, please email me at mwf62@cornell.edu, and I can install them into the project environment.

## Development

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`        | Installs dependencies                              |
| `pnpm dev`            | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`        |
| `pnpm build`          | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `pnpm preview`        | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `pnpm astro ...`      | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro preview` |
| `pnpm astro --help`   | Get help using the Astro CLI                       |

## Technical Overview

### Built with Astro

This website is built using Astro, a modern static site generator that delivers excellent performance by shipping minimal JavaScript.

### TailwindCSS

The site uses TailwindCSS for styling, a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.
